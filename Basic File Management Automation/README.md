# Basic File Management Automation
This PowerShell script organizes files in a given directory by moving them into subfolders based on their file type.

## 📌 How It Works:
- Creates `Images` and `Documents` subdirectories.
- Moves `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and `.png` files into `Images/`
- Moves `.pdf`, `.docx`, and `.txt` files into `Documents/`

## 🚀 Why This Project?
As a server administrator for 4 years, I'm now taking PowerShell more seriously.  
This project is part of my **learning journey**—breaking down larger scripts into **small, manageable steps**.
This is one of my first projects!

## 🛠 Try It Yourself!
1. Place some `.jpg`, `.pdf`, or `.txt` files in the `test-files/` folder.
2. Run `draft-2.ps1` in PowerShell.
3. Watch the script organize files into subdirectories!

## 🔄 Script Versions:
- `draft-1.ps1` → My first attempt, basic logic. No path checking. I did not comment as much as I should have.
- `draft-2.ps1` → Improved with better error handling and efficiency.
- `final.ps1` → Coming Soon! Will allow User to decide what files to organize and more!
