# PowerShell-Learning-Journey
## 📌 About This Repository

Welcome to my **PowerShell Learning Journey**! As a **server administrator with 4 years of experience**, I’ve decided to take a structured approach to learning PowerShell more seriously.

This repository contains **small PowerShell projects**, ranging from simple to complex, designed to:
- Improve my understanding of PowerShell syntax.
- Break down large scripts into small, manageable steps.
- Reinforce learning through multiple use of commands.
- Document progress with multiple drafts of each script.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each project is organized into its own directory with:
- 📜 **README.md** → A description of the project, goals, and how it works.
- 🖥️ **Drafts of the script** (`draft-1.ps1`, `draft-2.ps1`, etc.) to show progression.
- 🗂 **Test files** (`test-files/`) so others can try out the script.
